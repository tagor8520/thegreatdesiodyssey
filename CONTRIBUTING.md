# Contributing to The Great Desi Odyssey 🇮🇳

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **The Great Desi Odyssey**! We want to build the most epic, meme-filled, culturally rich virtual representation of India, and community contributions are the absolute best way to do that.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

We are an inclusive, welcoming community. Whether you're adding a detailed monument or a niche regional meme, please ensure your contributions are:
1. **Respectful**: Celebrate the culture. Humor and memes are highly encouraged, but strictly avoid political, religious, or maliciously offensive content.
2. **Collaborative**: Be kind in code reviews and discussions.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute (The Git Workflow)

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the project to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thegreatdesiodyssey.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch** for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-punjab-state
   ```
4. **Code** and test your changes locally (`npm run dev`).
5. **Commit** your changes with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add Punjab state and Makki di Roti collectible"
   ```
6. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request (PR)** against our `main` branch.

## 🗺️ Experimental Low-Code State Format

The long-term goal is a validated content pipeline that generates chunked states, landmarks, and collectibles without requiring contributors to write Three.js code. The JSON below documents the proposed authoring direction.

> **Current status:** files under `public/content/states/` are not yet loaded by the current game runtime. A state contribution must include the runtime integration until the compiler described in `PROJECT_AUDIT.md` is implemented.

### Draft State JSON

Draft state data belongs under `public/content/states/` (for example, `punjab.json`). Treat the format as experimental until a versioned schema and validator are added.

**Example: `punjab.json`**
```json
{
  "stateId": "punjab",
  "name": "Punjab",
  "zoneBounds": {
    "zMin": 160,
    "zMax": 260,
    "xMin": -80,
    "xMax": 80
  },
  "landmarks": [
    {
      "id": "tractor",
      "name": "Desi Tractor",
      "position": { "x": 10, "y": 0, "z": 200 },
      "voxels": [
        [0,0,0,"#000000"], [2,0,0,"#000000"],
        [0,1,0,"#FF0000"], [1,1,0,"#FF0000"], [2,1,0,"#FF0000"],
        [2,2,0,"#333333"]
      ]
    }
  ],
  "collectibles": [
    {
      "id": "makki_di_roti",
      "name": "Makki di Roti & Sarson da Saag",
      "icon": "🍲",
      "description": "🍲 Pure Desi Ghee power! +2x Strength for 15s!",
      "buff": { "type": "strength", "multiplier": 2.0, "duration": 15000 },
      "voxels": [
        [0,0,0,"#DAA520"], [1,0,0,"#DAA520"], [2,0,0,"#DAA520"],
        [0,0,1,"#DAA520"], [1,0,1,"#006400"], [2,0,1,"#DAA520"],
        [0,0,2,"#DAA520"], [1,0,2,"#DAA520"], [2,0,2,"#DAA520"]
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "patiala_lassi",
      "name": "Patiala Lassi",
      "icon": "🥛",
      "description": "🥛 Heavy Lassi! +Max Stamina but slows movement slightly.",
      "buff": { "type": "stamina", "multiplier": 3.0, "duration": 20000 },
      "voxels": [
        [0,0,0,"#FFFFFF"], [1,0,0,"#FFFFFF"],
        [0,1,0,"#FFFFFF"], [1,1,0,"#FFFFFF"],
        [0,2,0,"#FFFFFF"], [1,2,0,"#FFFFFF"],
        [0.5,3,0,"#F5DEB3"]
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧊 Procedural Voxel Asset Guide

We have a strict **Zero External Assets** policy. All models must be procedurally generated arrays of voxels. 

When defining a 3D object in JavaScript or JSON, use the `[x, y, z, hexColor]` format.

*   `x`, `y`, `z`: Integer coordinates relative to the object's origin.
*   `hexColor`: A valid hex string (e.g., `"#FF5500"`).

**Example: Building a simple 3x3 flag**
```javascript
const flagVoxels = [
  // Saffron top
  [0, 2, 0, "#FF9933"], [1, 2, 0, "#FF9933"], [2, 2, 0, "#FF9933"],
  // White middle
  [0, 1, 0, "#FFFFFF"], [1, 1, 0, "#000080"], [2, 1, 0, "#FFFFFF"], // Navy blue chakra in center
  // Green bottom
  [0, 0, 0, "#138808"], [1, 0, 0, "#138808"], [2, 0, 0, "#138808"]
];
```

*Tip: Use an online voxel editor (like MagicaVoxel) to plan your coordinates, then map them into an array!*

## ✅ Testing & Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a Pull Request, please ensure you have completed the following:

- [ ] **Run locally**: Did you run `npm run dev` and ensure there are no console errors?
- [ ] **No Z-Fighting**: Check that your newly added voxel models don't flicker against the ground or other models.
- [ ] **Performance**: Did you reuse materials or utilize the `VoxelBuilder` properly? Ensure your additions don't drop the framerate below 60FPS.
- [ ] **Zero Placeholders**: Ensure you haven't left any `// TODO: add voxels here` comments in production files.
- [ ] **Formatting**: Ensure your code matches the existing style (2-space indents, vanilla ES Modules).

We can't wait to see what you build! Be Creative! 🇮🇳
